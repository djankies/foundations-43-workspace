                    Resistors are passive electrical components used to limit
                    electrical current in an electronic circuit. They implement
                    electrical resistance as a circuit element. Resistors are
                    typically used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels,
                    divide voltages, or terminate transmission lines among other
                    uses. Their resistance values are measured in units called
                    ohms (Î©). The value or resistance level of a resistor is
                    often identified by a color code that is typically printed
                    on its surface. The larger the resistance value a resistor
                    has, the more it opposes (i.e., resists) the current flow.
                    There are different types of resistors based on the material
                    they are made from, their power rating, and their tolerance
                    (the acceptable deviation from the stamped value). Some
                    common types include fixed resistors, variable resistors,
                    carbon composition resistors, metal film resistors,
                    wire-wound resistors, and semiconductor resistors.

                    Capacitors are passive electronic components that store
                    electrical energy in an electric field. The process of
                    storing energy in the capacitor is known as "charging", and
                    involves electric charges of equal magnitude, but opposite
                    sign, building up on each plate. Capacitors are commonly
                    used in electronic circuits for blocking direct current
                    while allowing alternating current to pass, in filter
                    networks, for energy storage, tuners, and in power
                    conditioning, among other applications. They are available
                    in various forms, sizes, and materials for different
                    applications. Capacitors consist of two conductive plates
                    separated by an insulating material called a dielectric. The
                    conductive plates can be thin films of metal, alloy foil, or
                    aluminum foil, while dielectrics can be made of various
                    materials such as air, paper, plastic, glass, ceramic, or
                    even a vacuum. The effectiveness of a capacitor is known as
                    its capacitance, which is measured in farads (F), named
                    after English scientist Michael Faraday. The capacitance
                    value essentially tells you how much energy the capacitor
                    can store.

                    Inductors are electrical components that store energy in a
                    magnetic field when an electric current flows through them.
                    They are often used in electrical circuits due to their
                    property of resisting changes in the current. Structurally,
                    inductors are typically made of a coil of conducting
                    material, like copper wire, usually wound around a core made
                    from iron, air, or other materials.

                    Diodes are semiconductor devices that allow current to flow
                    in one direction but not the other. They are used in several
                    electronic circuits and devices and have two terminals,
                    anode (positive) and cathode (negative). The fundamental
                    property of a diode is its tendency to conduct electric
                    current in only one direction. Functionally, diodes work by
                    having an "on" state, where they allow current to flow, and
                    an "off" state, where they prevent it. When voltage is
                    applied to the diode in one direction, it becomes
                    forward-biased and allows current to flow. When voltage is
                    applied in the reverse direction, the diode becomes
                    reverse-biased, blocking current. Diodes have a multitude of
                    applications including power conversion (rectification),
                    voltage regulation, switching, signal modulation, and many
                    others.

                    Transistors are semiconductor devices used to amplify or
                    switch electronic signals and electrical power. They are one
                    of the basic building blocks of modern electronics. It is
                    composed of semiconductor material usually with at least
                    three terminals for connection to an external circuit. A
                    voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's
                    terminals controls the current through another pair of
                    terminals. Transistors are categorized into two types:
                    Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) and Field-Effect
                    Transistor (FET). The key functions they perform include
                    signal amplification, regulation of electrical signals, and
                    acting as a switch.
