# Foundations VS Code Workspace

This repository contains a Visual Studio Code workspace that simplifies your folder management and allows you to access all the projects from the DevMountain Foundations Course by clicking one file.

## üñ•Ô∏è Workspaces in Visual Studio Code

A VS Code workspace is a concept that allows you to organize and manage your code files, configurations, and dependencies within a single package. It provides a convenient way to work on multiple related projects or files simultaneously.

In the context of this repository, the workspace contains all the daily coding challenges, exercises/labs, and lecture demos from the DevMountain Foundations Course organized by week and day into a folder structure. All the code files (_Code Challenges, Exercises/Labs, Demos_), exist within this repository and you only ever need to open one file in Visual Studio Code to access every project within the file browser.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Downloading and Opening the Workspace

1. Click on the green `Code` button and then `Download ZIP`. `$ git clone [URL]` works too.
2. Once the ZIP file is downloaded, extract it to your desired location.
3. Open Visual Studio Code.
4. Click on `File` > `Open WorkSpace from File...` and navigate to inside the extracted folder. Select `foundations.code-workspace` and click `Open`.
5. Alternatively you can just double click the `foundations.code-workspace` file in your file explorer or drag and drop it into a VS Code window.

Ensure you see `FOUNDATIONS (WORKSPACE)` at the top of your side bar.

## üö® IMPORTANT

**Don't change the folder location or names unless you also know how to edit the workspace file as well. VS Code will get** _C**o**NF**uS**iOn_.

## üí´ Helpful Extensions

The workspace is pre-configured with a list of extensions that are useful for working with Javascript, HTML and CSS. When you open the workspace, you'll be prompted to install these extensions. You can choose to install all of them, pick the ones you need, or‚Äì if you miss feelings of sadness, worthlessness, irritability and despair, none at all! `(‡∏á^Ô∏†.^Ô∏°)‡∏á`

If you want to install extensions later, you can do so by clicking on the `Extensions` view in the Activity Bar on the side of the window, searching for the extension name, and clicking the `Install` button. You can also disable or uninstall extensions at any time from that same page.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workspace Settings

The workspace settings are configured in the `foundations.code-workspace` file. These settings are automatically applied when you open the workspace in Visual Studio Code. These take precedence over user settings and are mostly just ensure VS Code plays nicely with the recommended extensions. Oh, also‚Äì I turned on autosave for you.

## üìÅ Hierarchy

Each week has a dedicated folder. Within each week's folder are seven sub-folders; one for each day of the week. Each day's folder contains 1-3 folders: the Challenge, Lab, and Demo. Some days may not have a Lab or Demo folder since we don't always have a lab or demo. Friday's folder is almost always empty. (Fill it with your own stuff! Or don't. It's your life. Live it how you want to.)

The file hierarchy is as follows:

``` text block
/ Foundations
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1week
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2week
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ etc...

      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1-monday
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2-tuesday
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ etc...

        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Challenge <--||These 3 folders are  
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Exercise  <--||the same ones downloaded
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Demo      <--||on the course site.
                            
                            

```

## üë©‚Äçüíª Using Git

You can use git how you always do. `cd` to the _challenge_ or _lab_ folder, run `git init`, `git add`, etc. Keep in mind, the VS Code terminal might not open to the correct directory when you switch between folders or open a workspace, so always ensure you initialize git in the correct folder.
